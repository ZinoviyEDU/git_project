    <h1>About Stainless Steel Rat</h1>
    <p><img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="photo, maybe not real"></p>
    <p>James Bolivar diGriz, alias "Slippery Jim" and "The Stainless Steel Rat",
        is a fictional character and a series of comic science fiction novels written by Harry Harrison.</p>
    <p>James Bolivar diGriz goes by many aliases, including "Slippery Jim" and "The Stainless Steel Rat".
        He is a futuristic con man, thief, and all-round rascal. He is charming and quick-witted.
        He is also a master of disguise and martial arts, an accomplished bank robber, a criminal mastermind,
        an expert on breaking and entering, and (perhaps most usefully) a skilled liar. Master of self-rationalization,
        the Rat frequently justifies his crimes by arguing that he is providing society with entertainment;
        and besides which, he only steals from institutions that he believes have insurance coverage and so will be
        able to recoup their losses. He displays a strong sense of morality, albeit in a much more restricted sense
        than is traditional. For example, diGriz will steal without compunction, but deplores killing. </p>
    <p>The character was introduced in Harrison's short story "The Stainless Steel Rat", first published in 1957 in
        Astounding magazine. The story introduces the Rat, who has just carried out a successful larceny operation,
        and subsequently details a complex bank robbery the Rat pulls off with ease; however, he is outfoxed by the
        mysterious "Special Corps" — a crime-fighting organization staffed with former criminals — and recruited by
        them in order to fight crime. Harrison used the story, with minor modifications, as the introduction to the
        series's first full-length novel, also called The Stainless Steel Rat. Like other characters created by
        Harrison, the Rat is a speaker of Esperanto and advocates atheism. </p>
