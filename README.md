this aaplication app.py contains 6 separate apps.
all they run internally on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ port - so when adding

1. text from requirements file
2. number of xx faked users - names and emails (add the int number of users after slash)
3. result of calculations for CSV file 
4. number of astronauts that currently are in the space
5. will encode your string (add a string after path)
6. will decode your string - you can check it applying the result of 5 and
getting your firstly entered string (add a previously encoded string after path)
